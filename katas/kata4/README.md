# Valid Number
Validate if a given string is numeric.

## Example:
```
"0" => true
" 0.1 " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true
```

## Requirements:
Apart from the examples shown above, numbers with a correctly placed comma like 1,000 are accepted, decimals before "e"
 like 2.5e10 are also accepted. Empty spaces before and after the number ("  10", "10  ") are also valid.

## Solution:
In our Programming Languages we saw a similar problem and we used a finite
automata to solve it. I found it difficult to program the automata and couldn't
complete it, however the automata design is attached as an image.
